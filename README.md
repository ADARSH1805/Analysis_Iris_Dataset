# 🌸 Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my *Summer Training Internship Project* on the *Iris Dataset, conducted under the **Angaar Batch* and guided by *Ms. Gaurika Dhingra*. This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on one of the most well-known datasets in data science.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The *Iris dataset* consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample has four features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Jupyter Notebook*
- *Pandas*
- *NumPy*
- *Matplotlib*
- *Seaborn*

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

### 1. 🔍 Data Exploration
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Displayed the first and last few records
- Examined structure using .info(), .describe(), .shape()
- Renamed columns for simplicity (sepal_length, etc.)
- Identified unique values and species distribution

### 2. 📈 Statistical Summary
- Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance
- Identified min/max values for all numeric features

### 3. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing and duplicate values
- Removed duplicate rows
- Cleaned and structured the dataset for modeling

### 4. 📉 Outlier Detection & Removal
- Applied *IQR method* to find outliers in sepal_width
- Visualized and removed outliers to improve data quality

### 5. 📊 Data Visualization
#### Univariate Plots
- Countplot of species
- Boxplot of sepal length
- Violin plot of petal length

#### Multivariate Plots
- Scatter plots for various feature combinations
- Pair plot to show pairwise relationships
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features

## 📚 Future Scope

This cleaned and visualized dataset can now be used for building:
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier*
- *Logistic Regression*
- *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
- *Decision Trees*
